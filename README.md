# yainterfaceliftdownloader

Yet another interfacelift downloader 
It's a fun project. The main purpose is downloading of amazing landscapes from interfacelift.com for fun. Now the project is coming to the end. But there are still a few non-critical issues. 

## The application has next functions:
- Scan interfacelift.com, seek for new pictures. 
- Maintain pictures database. 
- Download pictures thumbnails. The app will download full picture version if user will like it. 
- Show user thumbnails, let user like or dislike pictures, view the pictures using status filter. 
- Scan pictures for broking (external changes, deleting, etc), repairs broken pictures. 
- Be robust to app restarts 
 
## I had several reasons to start the project:
- Try Java8 stream api 
- Try very desired Java8 CompletableFuture 
- Try groovy language (used in the project for unit tests) 
- Try lombok library to decrease boilerplate code (getter, setter, toString, trivial constructors) 
- Try TypeScript and Angular2 library 
 
## Used technologies:
- Java8, Groovy, TypeScript 
- Spring (DI, Boot, REST, Data) 
- JUnit, Mockito 
- Gradle 
- Angular2
